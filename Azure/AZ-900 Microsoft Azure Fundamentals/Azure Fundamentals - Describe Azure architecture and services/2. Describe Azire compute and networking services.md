## **Azure Virtual Machines**


VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in a form of a virtualized sercer and can be used in many ways. VMs are an ideal choich when you need:


- Total control over the operating system (OS).
- The ability to run custom software.
- To use custom hosting configurations.


### Scale VMs in Azure

You can run single VMs for testing, development, or minor tasks. Or you can group VMs together to provide high availability, scalability, and redudancy.


#### **Virtual machine scale sets**

*Virtual machine scale sets* let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. If you simply created multiple VMs with the same purpose. Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand, or you can set it to scale based on a defined schedule. Virtual machine scale sets also automatically deploy a load balancer to make sure that your resources are being used efficiently. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.

#### **Virtual machine availability sets**
*Virtual machine availability sets* are another tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment. 

Availability sets do this by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain.

- **Update domain**: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping will be offline at a time.

- **Fault domain**: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set will split your VMs across up to three fault domains.


### Example of when to use VMs

Some common examples or use cases for virtual machines include:

- **During testing and development**: VMs provide a quick and easy way to create different OS and application configurations.

- **When running applications in the cloud**: The ability to run certain applications in the public cloud as opposed to creating a traditional infrastructure to run them can provide substantial economic benefits.

- **When extending your datacenter to the cloud**: An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network.

- **During disaster recovery**: As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the cloud, you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery


### Move to the cloud with VMs

VMs are also an excellent choice when you move from a physical server to the cloud (also known as ***lift and shift***). You can create an image of the physical server and host it within a VM with little or no changes.

### VM Resources

When you provision a VM, you’ll also have the chance to pick the resources that are associated with that VM, including:

- Size (purpose, number of processor cores, and amount of RAM)
- Storage disks (hard disk drives, solid state drives, etc.)
- Networking (virtual network, public IP address, and port configuration)



## **Create an Azure Virtual Machine**

### Task 1: Create a Linux virtual machine and install Nginx

1. From Cloud Shell, run the following `az vm create` command to create a Linux VM:

    ```powershell
    az vm create \
      --resource-group learn-b06b4e6a-418f-4bcc-b62a-c69bda64a9dd \
      --name my-vm \
      --image UbuntuLTS \
      --admin-username azureuser \
      --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

2. Run the following `az vm extension set` command to configure Nginx on your VM:

    ```powershell
    az vm extension set \
      --resource-group learn-b06b4e6a-418f-4bcc-b62a-c69bda64a9dd \
      --vm-name my-vm \
      --name customScript \
      --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions \
      --version 2.1 \
      --settings '{"fileUris":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-welcome-to-azure/master/configure-nginx.sh"]}' \
      --protected-settings '{"commandToExecute": "./configure-nginx.sh"}'
    ```
    This command uses the Custom Script Extension to run a Bash script on your VM. The script is stored on GitHub.

    To summarize, the script:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    > Runs apt-get update to download the latest package information from the internet. 

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y nginx
    ```
    > Installs Nginx.

    ```
    echo "<html><body><h2>Welcome to Azure! My name is $(hostname).</h2></body></html>" | sudo tee -a /var/www/html/index.html
    ```
    >Sets the home page, /var/www/html/index.html, to print a welcome message that includes your VM's host name.


## **Describe Azure Virtual Desktop**

[video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE4LRpC?postJsllMsg=true)

***Azure Virtual Desktop*** is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. 

### Enhance security

***Azure Virtual Desktop*** provides centralized security management for users desktops with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can enable multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins. You can also secure access to data by assigning [granular role-based access controls](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-granular-access-control) (RBACs) to users.

### Multi-session Windows 10 or Windows 11 deployment

Azure Virtual Desktop lets you use Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, the only Windows client-based operating system that enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM.

## **Describe Azure Containers**

If you want to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, ***containers*** are an excellent choice.

### What are containers?

***Containers*** are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host. Containers are lightweight and designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically. It's possible to create and deploy virtual machines as application demand increases, but containers are a lighter weight, more agile method. One of the most popular container engines is Docker, which is supported by Azure.

### Compare virtual machines to containers

[video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE2yuaq?postJsllMsg=true)


### Azure Container Instances

Azure Container Instances offer the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure; without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services. Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering. 

## **Describe Azure Functions**

Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute option that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers.

### Create an Azure account

([video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RWK1QU?postJsllMsg=true))

You can purchase Azure access directly from Microsoft by signing up on the Azure website or through a Microsoft representative. For more information on how to create an Azure account, see the [Create an Azure account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-an-azure-account/) learning module.

### What is the Azure free account?

The Azure free account includes:

- Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.
- A credit to use for the first 30 days.
- Access to more than 25 products that are always free.

The Azure free account is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore. To sign up, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account.


### What is the Azure free account?

The Azure free student account offer includes:

- Free access to certain Azure services for 12 months.
- A credit to use in the first 12 months.
- Free access to certain software developer tools.

The [Azure free student account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) is an offer for students that gives $100 credit and free developer tools. Also, you can sign up without a credit card.

### What is the Microsoft Learn sandbox?

Many of the Learn exercises use a technology called the sandbox, which creates a temporary subscription that's added to your Azure account. This temporary subscription allows you to create Azure resources during a Learn module. 


## **Exercise - Explore the Learn sandbox**

Once the sandbox launches, half the screen will be in PowerShell command line interface (CLI) mode.

### Task 1: Use the PowerShell CLI

Use the PowerShell `Get-date` command to get the current date and time.

```Powershell
Get-date
```

Most Azure specific commands will start with the letters `az`. The` Get-date` command you just ran is a PowerShell specific command. Let's try an Azure command to check what version of the CLI you're using right now.

```Powershell
az version
```


### Task 2: Use the BASH CLI

If you’re more familiar with BASH, you can use BASH command instead by shifting to the BASH CLI.

Enter `bash` to switch to the BASH CLI.

```Powershell
bash
```

In BASH, Use the `date` command to get the current date and time.

```bash
date
```

Just like in the PowerShell mode of the CLI, you can use the letters `az` to start an Azure command in the BASH mode. Try to run an update to the CLI with `az upgrade`.

```bash
az upgrade
```

You can change back to PowerShell mode by entering `pwsh` on the BASH command line.

### Task 3: Use Azure CLI interactive mode

Another way to interact is using the Azure CLI interactive mode. This changes CLI behavior to more closely resemble an integrated development environment (IDE).

Enter `az interactive` to enter interactive mode.

```bash
az interactive
```

Decide whether you wish to send telemetry data and enter YES or NO.

You may have to wait a minute or two to allow the interactive mode to fully initialize. Then, enter the letter “a” and auto-completion should start to work.

<img src=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/azure-interactive-mode-c8421a2d.png  height="400">

Try the `upgrade` or `version` commands again, but this time without az in front.

```powershell
version
```


```powershell
upgrade
```

The commands should have worked the same as before, and given you the same results. Use the `exit` command to leave interactive mode.


```powershell
exit
```

### Task 4: Use the Azure portal

You’ll also have the option of using the Azure portal during sandbox exercises. You need to use the link provided in the exercise to access the Azure portal.

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com) to check out the Azure web interface. Once in the portal, you can see all the services Azure has to offer as well as look around at resource groups and so on.


## **Azure physical infrastructure**

### Physical infrastructure

The physical infra for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters.

As a global cloud provider, Azure has datacenters around the world which grouped into *Azure Regions* or *Azure Availability Zones* that are designed to help achieving resiliency and reliability for business-critical workloads.

The [Global infrastructure](https://infrastructuremap.microsoft.com/) site gives you a chance to interactively explore the underlying Azure infrastructure.

### Regions

A *region* is a geographical area on the planet that can contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.

### Availability Zones

*Availability zones* are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

<img src=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/availability-zones-c22f95a3.png  height="400">

### Use availability zones in your apps

Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:


- Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
- Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
- Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.

### Region pairs

Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region

Examples of region pairs in Azure are West US paired with East US and South-East Asia paired with East Asia.

<img src=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/region-pairs-7c495a33.png  height="400">


### Sovereign Regions

Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure.



## **Azure management infrastructure**

The management infrastructure includes Azure resources and resource groups, subscriptions, and accounts. 

### Azure resources and resource groups

A ***resource*** is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.

***Resource groups*** are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group. While a resource group can contain many resources, a single resource can only be in one resource group at a time.

Resource groups provide a convenient way to group resources together. When you apply an action to a resource group, that action will apply to all the resources within the resource group.

### Azure subscriptions

In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. 

<img src=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/subscriptions-d415577b.png  height="200">

An account can have multiple subscriptions, but it’s only required to have one. In a multi-subscription account, you can use the subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different access-management policies.

You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources. There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:

- **Billing boundary**: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure
- **Access control boundary:**: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures.

### Create additional Azure subscriptions

Similar to using resource groups to separate resources by function or access, you might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management purposes. for example, you might want to create additional subscription to seperate:

- **Environments**: You can choose to create subscriptions to set up separate environments for development and testing, security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.
- **Organizational structures**: You can create subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures.
- **Billing**: You can create additional subscriptions for billing purposes.

### Azure management groups

Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions. If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions.

### Management group, subscriptions, and resource group hierarchy

You can build a flexible structure of management groups and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy for unified policy and access management. For instance:

<img src=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/management-groups-subscriptions-dfd5a108.png height="400">

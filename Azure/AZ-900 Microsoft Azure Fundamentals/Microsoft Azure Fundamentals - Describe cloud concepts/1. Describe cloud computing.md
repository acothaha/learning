## **Introduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals**

***Microsoft Azure*** is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help build solutions to meet business goals.

In this series, we will cover cloud computing basics, be introduced to some of the core services provided by ***Microsoft Azure***, and will learn more about the governence and compliance service that can be used.

### Why should I take Azure Fundamentals?

You should take this course if you:

1. Have general interest in Azure or in the cloud
2. Want ot earn official certification from Microsoft (AZ-900)

The Azure Fundamentals learning path series can help to prepare for examp AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. This exam includes three domain areas:

| AZ-900 Domain Area      | Weight |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Describe cloud concepts  | 25-30% |
| Describe Azure architecture and services   | 35-40%        |
| Describe Azure management and governance      | 30-35%       |

## **What is cloud computing?**

([video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE4LyBB?postJsllMsg=true))

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

But the basic services provided by all cloud providers are:

1. *Compute power* -> How much processing a computer can do. With cloud computing you can add or remove the compute power as you needed
2. *Storage* -> Volume of data you can store. With cloud computing you can scale up/down your storage and they will make sure there is backup and running 24 H a day.

## **Describe the shared responsibility model**

In its simplest terms, the ***Shared Responsibility Model*** dictates that the cloud provider—such as Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)—must monitor and respond to security threats related to the cloud itself and its underlying infrastructure. Meanwhile, end users, including individuals and companies, are responsible for protecting data and other assets they store in any cloud environment.

The following diagram highlights how the Shared Responsibility Model informs who is responsible for what, depending on the cloud service type.

You'll always be responsible for:

- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (phones, computers, etc)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within you organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructures

## **Define cloud models**

***Cloud models*** defince the deployment type of cloud resources

### Private cloud

***Private cloud*** is a cloud that is used by a single entity.

### Public cloud

***Public cloud*** is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider.

### Hybrid cloud

***Hybrid cloud*** is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. 

The following table highlights a few key comparative aspects between the cloud models:

| Public cloud | Private cloud | Hybrid cloud |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| No capital expenditures to scale up  | Organizations have complete control over resources and security | Provides the most flexibility |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned | Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data  | Organizations determine where to run their applications |
| Organizations pay only for what they use 	   | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance  | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates  | |


### Multi-cloud

In a ***multi-cloud*** environment, you deal with two (or more) public providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

### Azure Arc

***Azure Arc*** is a set of tech that helps manage the cloud environment.

### Azure VMware Solution

What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.


## **Describe the consumption-based model**

Generally, in IT infrastructures models, there are two types of expenses to consider:

1. *Capital expenditure* (CapEx) -> A one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. e.g. A new building, building a new datacenter, etc.
2. *Operational expenditure* (OpEx) -> expenditure on services or products over time. e.g. renting a convention center, signing up for cloud services, etc.

Cloud computing falls under the OpEx since cloud computing operates on a ***consumption-based model***. With cloud computing, you don't pay for hte physical infra, electicity, security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter.

Consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

- No upfront costs
- No need to purchase and manage costly infra that users might not use to its fullest potential
- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
